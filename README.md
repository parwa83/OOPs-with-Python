This repository is a simple and structured collection of Python programs designed to help learners clearly understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
concepts through practical examples. Each file focuses on a specific idea—such as classes, constructors, inheritance, and operator overloading—making it easy to learn step by step 
without unnecessary complexity. The code is written in a clean and beginner-friendly way, making it useful not only for students starting with Python but also for anyone revising OOP fundamentals 
or preparing for technical interviews.

The examples are written with a learning-first approach, focusing on clarity rather than shortcuts.

Concepts are broken down into small, independent files so learners don’t feel overwhelmed.

Ideal for hands-on practice, not just theory reading.

Helps build the right OOP mindset, not just syntax familiarity.

Suitable for quick revision before exams or interviews.

Encourages writing clean, maintainable Python code.

Useful as a personal reference repository while learning Python.
